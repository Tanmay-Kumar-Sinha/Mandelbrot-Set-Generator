Soon to be added features:-
1. Streamlining of the features so that you can create the image with just one program, and can change properties such as resolution, color palette, the region of the complex plane where you want to see the image, with just one script.
2. Optimization, so that the code does not take as long to run.
3. Better memory management.
4. The functionality to create Julia sets given a function and the other properties.
