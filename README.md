# Mandelbrot Set Generator

Simple Mandelbrot set generator, along with other similar object generator, such as Julia sets, written just for fun.

Usage is similar for all the various sets:- just compile the code and run. In addition to this, there is a python  script which generates a movie based on various Julia sets, similar to the following:-https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/JSr07885.gif

The old version, which works slower but can add colour to the plots, is also present.
